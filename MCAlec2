Sofware Procceses Steps 
- Specifications, Development, Deployment, Evolution 


Software Process Model- explicit description of software process
,abstraction (hiding) of stated process


Software Crisis - sizes, quality, cost, delay delivery 


program is combination of source code and object code
software is not only program, 


Doumentation manuals - 
- Analysis/Specification (DFD, Context Diagrams)
- Design(Flowcharts, Entity Relationship Diagrams)
-Implementation (source code listings, cross reference listings)
-Testing(Test Data, Test Result) 


Operating Procedeure 
- how to install and utilize software system
- Installatuion guiudes, ref guides .etc. 


Preciptive Process Models (all are 7 phases)

- Waterfall Model/ Classic Lifecycle Model /Linear Sequintial Model/casscading
step by step, cant go back, based on build and fix model 

uses good habits : define before design and design before code

Advantages - clear uunderstanding of need, simple to manage, quality, theoritical

disadvanategs - not good for complex projects, risk is high, not practical 

- Incremental Porccess Model
breaks into parts 

end phases is the first phases of next incremental 

Advantages - flexible,  easy to test and debug, 

Disadvantages- reqires clear and complete planning, demand of customer, 


-RAD(Rapid Application Development)
short period of time 
commuciation between customer and developer 
requirements diivided into different groups 
proof of concept

-Spiral Model/Mera Model

4 stage of iteration and process is cummalitive 
REDUCES RISKS (IMP)

Risk Analysis 

applied to medium to high risk project
long term project commitment 

Advantages -



Disadvantages - Management complex, complex process, spiral go indefinetely, excess documentation

 










SCRUM AGILE model is currently used
