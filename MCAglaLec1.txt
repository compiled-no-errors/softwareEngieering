Software is collection of programs, documentation and operating procedures. (IMP)

Characterstics of sofwtare -
- it is created or engineered 
- it does not degrade with time 
- it is custom built (IMP point)


Types of software - 
system software 
application software 
AI software and many more 


Sofware Product- created to meet specific need


Sofware Engineering - creating software products based on scientific concepts, practices and procedures 


Need for software engineering - change in user needs and environment 

Dynamic nature - dynamic means change 

new enhancement 

quality management 


Kinds of sofware- 

System software , Appklicatiobns, embedded software, Web Apps, Open Source, Productline Software, Ubiquitous Computing etc.


Legacy softwares are the old programmes that were created decades ago 
why - software must be modified, software architecture change and new needs for business requirements



Very IMP- 

Software Process-

1st Requirement (need) and Gather Info (Eliciation)
2nd Design and Implementation
3rd Validate and Test and Deploy
4th Maintenance (evloution)


Project Requirement -

 Project's Size , Difficulty, Customer Involvement, Familirity with  technology 


Product and Process -
End result of project is product 
step by step is process 


Sofware Process >>>>> Sosftware Project >>>>>> Software Product


Types of Software Product- 

Generic Products - common to all
Customized Products - specefically designed for someone

Characterstics of well engineered sofware product- 

Effeciency, Maintanibility, Dependability, In Time, Within Budget, Functionality 


Software Development Lifecycle (IMP)-

SDLC method to plan create and test high quality software 


7 phases -

1st Planning- 

requiremnt analysis,input from customers, feasibility , identify project risks and plan for the reqirements 

2nd Defining

describe and record the product needs, SRS document (sofwtare requireent specification)

3rd Designing the product architecture -

DDS 
product's architectural concepts


4th Building 

genrate code in organized way 


5th Testing


6th Deployment
